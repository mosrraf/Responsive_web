<h2>Getting started</h2>
</header>
<p>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van
Rossum and first released in 1991. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management
and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming,
and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library<br>Two major versions of Python are currently in active use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.x is the current version and is under active development.</li>
<li>Python 2.x is the legacy version and will receive only security updates until 2020. No new features will be
implemented. Note that many projects still use Python 2, although migrating to Python 3 is getting easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download and install either version of Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. See Python 3 vs. Python 2 for a comparison between
them. In addition, some third-parties offer re-packaged versions of Python that add commonly used libraries and
other features to ease setup for common use cases, such as math, data analysis or scientific use.<br>To confirm that Python was installed correctly, you can verify that by running the following command in your
favorite terminal (If you are using Windows OS, you need to add path of python to the environment variable before
using it in command prompt): </p>
<code>$ python --version<br>
Python 3.x Version ≥ 3.0</code>

<h2>Hello World in Python using IDLE</h2>
</header>
<p>IDLE is a simple editor for Python, that comes bundled with Python.<br><br>
<strong>How to create Hello, World program in IDLE</strong><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Open IDLE on your system of choice.</li>
<ul>
<li>In older versions of Windows, it can be found at All Programs under the Windows menu.</li>
<li>In Windows 8+, search for IDLE or find it in the apps that are present in your system.</li>
<li>On Unix-based (including Mac) systems you can open it from the shell by typing $ idle
python_file.py.</li>
</ul>
<li>It will open a shell with options along the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the shell, there is a prompt of three right angle brackets.
<br>
Now write the following code in the prompt and hit Enter:</p>
<code>>>> print("Hello World")
<br>
Hello World</code>

<section class="main-section" id="Creating_variables_and_assigning_values">
<header>
<h2>Creating variables and assigning values</h2>
</header>
<p>To create a variable in Python, all you need to do is specify the variable name, and then assign a value to it</p>
<code>variable name = value</code>
<p>Python uses = to assign values to variables.<br> There's no need to declare a variable in advance (or to assign a data
type to it), assigning a value to a variable itself declares and initializes the variable with that value.<br> There's no way to
declare a variable without assigning it an initial value.</p>
<code># Integer
a = 2<br>
print(a)<br>
# Output: 2<br>
# Integer<br>
b = 9223372036854775807<br>
print(b)<br>
# Output: 9223372036854775807<br>
# Floating point<br>
pi = 3.14<br>
print(pi)<br>
# Output: 3.14<br>
# String<br>
c = 'A'<br>
print(c)<br>
# Output: A<br>
# String<br>
name = 'John Doe'<br>
print(name)<br>
# Output: John Doe<br>
# Boolean<br>
q = True<br>
print(q)<br>
# Output: True<br>
# Empty value or null data type<br>
x = None<br>
print(x)<br>
# Output: None</code>

<section class="main-section" id="Block_Indentation">
<header>
<h2>Block Indentation</h2>
</header>
<p>Python uses indentation to define control and loop constructs. This contributes to Python's readability, however, it
requires the programmer to pay close attention to the use of whitespace. Thus, editor miscalibration could result in
code that behaves in unexpected ways.
<br><br>Python uses the colon symbol (:) and indentation for showing where blocks of code begin and end (If you come
from another language, do not confuse this with somehow being related to the ternary operator). That is, blocks in
Python, such as functions, loops, if clauses and other constructs, have no ending identifiers. All blocks start with a
colon and then contain the indented lines below it.<br></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<code>def my_function(): # This is a function definition. Note the colon (:)
<br><code>a = 2 # This line belongs to the function because it's indented
<br>return a # This line also belongs to the same function</code>
<br>print(my_function()) # This line is OUTSIDE the function block</code>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="User_Input">
<header>
<h2>User Input</h2>
</header>
<p>To get input from the user, use the input function:</p>
<code>Python 3.x Version ≥ 3.0<br>
name = input("What is your name? ")<br>
# Out: What is your name? </code>
<p>The function takes a string argument, which displays it as a prompt and returns a string. The above code provides a
prompt, waiting for the user to input.<br>The input after that is stored in name variable.</p>
